## **Introduction**

This program was created to help people in choosing a smartphone by utilizing netizen sentiment analysis on the YouTube platform. This application is designed to analyze comment sentiments using Deep Learning-based NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques.

This application aims to provide data-based recommendations that help people in making smartphone purchase decisions. With this application, it is expected that users can make more informative, efficient, and targeted decisions in choosing a smartphone.  

## **Background**
Based on one of the [journals](https://www.neliti.com/id/publications/171816/penentuan-karakteristik-pengguna-sebagai-pendukung-keputusan-dalam-memilih-smart#cite) said that smartphones have become an important necessity for various levels of society, both from the upper and lower classes. Along with increasing demand, various smartphone vendors offer a variety of prices, features, operating systems, and technologies. However, often the growing wants and needs of the community are not in line with the existing smartphone choices. This makes it difficult for many users to choose the right smartphone, because purchasing decisions are often influenced by prestige factors and consumptive behavior (Sandika, Ian G., et al., 2014).  

## **Objectives**
- Analyze the sentiment of YouTube video comments.
- Make it easier to understand public opinion with key sentiments and visualizations.
- Provide data-driven smartphone purchase recommendations.  

## **Methods**  
In working on this project, there are 2 methods that become the foundation for making applications, namely Web Scrapping and Modeling.

#### Web Scraping  
Web scraping in this project has 2 purposes, namely to collect data to train the model created and as _user input_ that can find out the results of sentiment analysis of a product _handphone_ released in 2024 and 2025.
- In collecting data, the source used comes from YouTube so that _labeling_ is done manually to determine positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- In the application's point of view, users will be faced with a display to see the results of sentiment analysis of a _handphone_ product released in 2024 and 2025 and a display that can enter the YouTube _link_ to be analyzed from the sentiment generated by the _handphone_ product so that it can help in making decisions in buying an item.  

#### Modeling  
Modeling aims to process text in the form of sentiment generated by a product, whether it is based on data that has been collected or comes from users in the form of _links_ so that it can find out whether a product leads to negative, positive, or neutral sentiment. The analysis belongs to the category of _Natural Language Processing_ which uses Deep Learning in the form of **Long Short-Term Memory**.
